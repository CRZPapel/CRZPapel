- 👋 Hi, I’m @CRZPapel
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, data science and software automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python since December 2020. Recently started learning to use data visualization tools like Power BI and Google Data Studio. Scripting language in Powershell, also Python for this kind of tasks ocasionally. At the moment I'm also trying to learn chinese and finish my degree in PolSci.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ??? I don't really know, for the moment I'm just happy finding challenging tasks to do that allow me to learn new things and meet people with similar interests, not only limited to coding.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
